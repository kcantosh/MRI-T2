MRI-T2
======

This MatLab code is designed to model T2 dephasing of protons following the 90 deg pulse as seen in a spin-echo sequence due to their diffusion and interaction with the mangetic field inhomogeniety created by nanoparticles. The algirithm is largely based on the paper by P.A. Hardy and R.M. Henkelman "Transverse relaxation rate enhancement caused by magnetic particulates" (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0730-725X(89)90549-3)
